# Social Login Project

This project implements social login with Google, Kakao, and Naver using Next.js and Auth.js.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Due to limitations in the development environment, dependencies were not installed automatically. Please run one of the following commands inside the `new-app` directory to install them:

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You should see the login page with buttons for Google, Kakao, and Naver.

### Important Note

The project is located in the `new-app` subdirectory. All commands should be run from there.
The environment variables are stored in `.env.local` and have been configured with the credentials you provided.
